# UK NEWS

A basic UK NEWS search app, which uses an API as a data source:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Web App Framework**: Vue

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

**HTTP client**: Axios

The UK NEWS app can dynamically search data requested from multiple APIs and return details stored for a corresponding result. It can filter through countries and cities in the UK and return a list of up-to-date news articles for the corresponding area. Each area uses a different API as a data source.
